In computer programming, the **strategy pattern** (also known as the policy pattern) is a behavioural software design pattern that enables an algorithm's behavior to be selected at runtime. The strategy pattern

* Defines a family of algorithms,
* Encapsulates each algorithm, and
* Makes the algorithms interchangeable within that family.

In Strategy pattern, a class behavior or its algorithm can be changed at run time. This type of design pattern comes under behavior pattern.

In Strategy pattern, we create objects which represent various strategies and a context object whose behavior varies as per its strategy object. The strategy object changes the executing algorithm of the context object.

Define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one, and make them interchangeable. Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.
